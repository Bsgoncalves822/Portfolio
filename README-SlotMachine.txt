The essence of this program is to demonstrate basic aptitude in python, 
and command over python syntex as well as programming logic (Ifs, elses, for loops, dealing with variables and functions)

Essentially, this program was deisgned to act a slot machine. 

It will prompt the user for a deposit, how many lines the player will choose to place a bet on, 
as well the amount he would like to place on each line. 

Each line is comprised of symbols that act as multipliers if the sam three symbols appear in a row. 
Every symbol has a different multiplier, leading to different multipliers for different symbol sequences. 

the program monitors the balance level to insure there are enough funds to keep playing while also updating the balance after each spin.
